1.Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    Middleware is part of the request and response cycle. Its what helps smooth the process between request and response objects.   
2.What does CRUD stand for?
    Create: we create the data
    Read: read the data
    Update: update values/data
    Delete: delete the data
3.You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    a. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
        We set up a dot env file to keep our private information private. Then, in our applicaiton we have to use a package 
        by the name of dotenv and we'll be able to access the variables from anywhere in our app. 
    b. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
        We add the dontenv file into our gitignore file so that git ignores those files and doesnt push them into our repo.
